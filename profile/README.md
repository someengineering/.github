## 💝 Check out Fix Inventory, our open source project 
[**Fix Inventory**](https://github.com/someengineering/fixinventory) 🐑 is an open source cloud security tool that offers comprehensive visibility and control over your cloud-native environment. 

Fix Inventory works for AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Hetzner and Kubernetes.

## 🎁 What’s under the hood of Fix Inventory?

Fix Inventory simplifies keeping your cloud(s) secure and compliant, with three core capabilities: 

1. **Agentless scanning** with our [cloud collector plugins](https://github.com/someengineering/fixinventory/tree/main/plugins) for a complete and and continuous assessment of your cloud(s) without impacting workload performance. 
2. **Normalization across clouds** with our [unified data model](https://inventory.fix.security/reference/unified-data-model) and abstractions for common cloud resources called ['base kinds'](https://inventory.fix.security/reference/unified-data-model/base-kinds). Think ‘database’, ‘bucket’ or ‘keypair’.
3. **Risk analysis** with our query language, full-text search and [pre-configured compliance frameworks](https://github.com/someengineering/fixcompliance) to scan your entire fleet. 

We’ve packaged all capabilities into a CLI and a REST API, so that you can integrate data from Fix Inventory with the rest of your cloud and security operations. We always envisioned Fix Inventory as a platform that others can build on. 

Fix Inventory is self-contained and can be deployed on your laptop or in the cloud. If you’re new to Fix Inventory, then:

## 👉 Don’t miss “Fix”, our SaaS product!

Fix is our hosted cloud security platform that comes with opinionated dashboards and pre-configured integrations. We’re drinking our own champagne, since Fix is built on top of Fix Inventory. 

It’s best for organizations who do not want to deal with self-hosting open source software, and with users who prefer using dashboards vs. a CLI.

 The genesis of the name “Fix”: When we asked security engineers for their biggest wish, it was to “fix all the things”.

## 🧙 Wait, but what is Some Engineering?

Some Engineering was founded in 2021 by engineers who previously worked at Mesosphere, Instana and Crittercism. We come with a background in analytics, observability and site reliability engineering. 

In our work, we noticed how there was always friction between security and infrastructure teams. One team wanted to move fast (infrastructure), but that made it harder for the other team (security) to do their job and stay in control. The friction got worse with a rising number of cloud services and multi-cloud environments. 

We built Fix Inventory to remove that friction, with a tool that infrastructure and security engineers both could use. Our goal is to help engineers move fast and build new infrastructure, without compromising security. 

How did we come up with the name? We joked how solving every hard problem will require “some engineering”, and that’s what stuck.
